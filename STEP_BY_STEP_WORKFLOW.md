# 🚀 Step-by-Step Roboflow Upload Workflow

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED: Progressive Upload Workflow**

The Roboflow upload tab now follows a clear 5-step process that guides users through the entire upload workflow.

### 📋 **Step-by-Step Process:**

#### **Step 1: 🔑 API Key**
- **Input**: Enter your Roboflow API key
- **Action**: Click "🔍 Test API" button
- **Result**: Validates API key and loads available workspaces
- **Status**: Shows connection status (🔴/🟡/🟢)

#### **Step 2: 🏢 Workspace Selection**
- **Trigger**: Enabled after successful API test
- **Options**: Dropdown populated with discovered workspaces
- **Fallback**: Includes known workspace "verify-workspace-od-1"
- **Status**: Shows workspace loading progress

#### **Step 3: 📂 Project Selection**
- **Trigger**: Enabled after workspace selection
- **Options**: Dropdown populated with projects from selected workspace
- **Fallback**: Includes known project "chatter-scratch-damage-2"
- **Status**: Shows project discovery results

#### **Step 4: 📊 Dataset Selection**
- **Options**: Shows all datasets with COCO annotations
- **Info**: Displays image count, annotation count, and classes
- **Source**: Scans both database and default "datasets" folder

#### **Step 5: 🚀 Upload**
- **Trigger**: Enabled when all previous steps are complete
- **Mode**: Always uploads as predictions (goes to "Unassigned")
- **Progress**: Real-time status log with detailed progress

### 🎯 **UI Features:**

#### **Progressive Enablement:**
- Each step is disabled until the previous step is completed
- Clear visual indicators (🔴/🟡/🟢) show progress
- Status messages guide the user through each step

#### **Smart Fallbacks:**
- Uses known workspace/project if discovery fails
- Handles API limitations gracefully
- Provides helpful error messages

#### **Real-time Feedback:**
- Status updates for each step
- Progress indicators during operations
- Detailed upload log with timestamps

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

#### **API Discovery:**
```python
# Test API and load workspaces
rf = Roboflow(api_key=api_key)
workspaces = rf.list_workspaces()

# Load projects for workspace
workspace = rf.workspace(workspace_name)
projects = workspace.list_projects()
```

#### **Upload Process:**
```python
# Upload with prediction mode
response = project.single_upload(
    image_path=image_path,
    annotation_path=coco_file,
    is_prediction=True,  # Goes to "Unassigned"
    num_retry_uploads=3
)
```

### 📊 **User Experience Flow:**

```
🔑 Enter API Key → 🔍 Test API → 🏢 Select Workspace → 
📂 Select Project → 📊 Select Dataset → 🚀 Upload
```

### 🎉 **Benefits:**

1. **🎯 Guided Process**: No confusion about what to do next
2. **🔒 Validation**: Each step validates before proceeding
3. **🔄 Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds available workspaces/projects
4. **📋 Clear Status**: Always know what's happening
5. **🛡️ Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API issues
6. **📤 Prediction Mode**: All uploads go to "Unassigned" for review
