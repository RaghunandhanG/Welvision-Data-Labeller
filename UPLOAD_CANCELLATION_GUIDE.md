# Upload Cancellation Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive upload cancellation functionality to handle app closure during Roboflow dataset uploads.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Cancellation Flag System**
- Added `self.upload_cancelled = False` flag to track cancellation state
- Flag is checked at strategic points during upload process
- Prevents new operations when cancellation is requested

### 2. **Enhanced App Closing Behavior**
- Modified `on_closing()` method to detect ongoing uploads
- Shows confirmation dialog when upload is in progress
- Offers choice to cancel upload and close or keep app open
- Prevents accidental data loss during upload

### 3. **Upload Worker Thread Enhancements**
- Added cancellation checks in `workspace_dataset_upload_worker()`
- Added cancellation checks in `individual_upload_worker()`
- Workers exit gracefully when cancellation flag is set
- Prevents wasted resources and partial uploads

### 4. **Main Upload Function Improvements**
- Added cancellation checks in `upload_dataset_using_workspace_method()`
- Checks before initialization, validation, and main upload call
- Returns `False` immediately when cancellation is detected
- Prevents API calls after cancellation

### 5. **UI Enhancements**
- Added "ðŸ›‘ Cancel Upload" button next to upload button
- Cancel button is enabled during uploads, disabled otherwise
- Upload button text changes to "ðŸ”„ Uploading..." during process
- Both buttons reset to normal state after completion/cancellation

### 6. **Error Handling Improvements**
- Enhanced `handle_upload_error()` to distinguish user cancellation
- Shows appropriate messages for cancellation vs actual errors
- Resets all UI states properly after cancellation
- Clears upload queues to prevent stale messages

### 7. **Graceful State Management**
- Proper reset of `upload_in_progress` and `upload_cancelled` flags
- UI buttons return to normal state after any completion
- Upload queues are cleared during cancellation
- Thread-safe state transitions

## Key Benefits

### âœ… **User Experience**
- Users can safely close the app during uploads
- Clear visual feedback about upload status
- Option to cancel long-running uploads
- No forced termination or data corruption

### âœ… **Data Integrity**
- Prevents partial uploads when user cancels
- Clean termination of upload processes
- No orphaned data in Roboflow
- Proper cleanup of temporary resources

### âœ… **Resource Management**
- Threads exit gracefully instead of being orphaned
- Network requests are stopped when possible
- Memory cleanup through queue clearing
- CPU usage stops when cancellation is requested

### âœ… **Error Prevention**
- No crash if app is closed during upload
- No hanging processes after app closure
- Clear error messages distinguish cancellation from failures
- Robust state management prevents UI inconsistencies

## Usage Instructions

### **Normal Upload Process:**
1. Start upload as usual with "ðŸš€ Upload Dataset to Roboflow" button
2. Upload button changes to "ðŸ”„ Uploading..." and is disabled
3. "ðŸ›‘ Cancel Upload" button becomes enabled
4. Monitor progress in the upload log

### **Cancelling an Upload:**
1. Click "ðŸ›‘ Cancel Upload" button during upload
2. Upload process stops gracefully
3. Status shows "ðŸ›‘ Upload cancelled by user"
4. Both buttons return to normal state

### **Closing App During Upload:**
1. Try to close the app window during upload
2. Confirmation dialog appears asking about cancellation
3. Choose "Yes" to cancel upload and close app
4. Choose "No" to keep app open and continue upload

## Technical Implementation

### **Thread Safety:**
- Uses `self.upload_cancelled` flag for thread communication
- Upload queues handle progress messages safely
- UI updates use `self.after()` for thread safety
- Daemon threads prevent hanging on app exit

### **Cancellation Points:**
- Before Roboflow SDK initialization
- Before dataset validation
- Before main upload API call
- After upload completion
- In worker thread entry points

### **UI State Management:**
```python
# During upload start:
self.rf_upload_btn.config(state='disabled', text="ðŸ”„ Uploading...")
self.rf_cancel_btn.config(state='normal')
self.upload_in_progress = True
self.upload_cancelled = False

# During cancellation:
self.upload_cancelled = True
self.upload_in_progress = False
self.rf_upload_btn.config(state='normal', text="ðŸš€ Upload Dataset to Roboflow")
self.rf_cancel_btn.config(state='disabled')
```

## Compatibility
- Works with both workspace.upload_dataset() method
- Works with individual image upload method
- Compatible with existing annotation_labelmap fixes
- Maintains all previous upload functionality
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Start Upload â†’ Cancel**: Test manual cancellation works
2. **Start Upload â†’ Close App**: Test app closing during upload
3. **Complete Upload**: Test normal completion still works
4. **Error During Upload**: Test error handling still works
5. **Multiple Cancellations**: Test rapid cancel/restart scenarios

This implementation provides a robust and user-friendly way to handle upload interruptions while maintaining data integrity and system stability.
