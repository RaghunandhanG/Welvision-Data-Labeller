## Issues Fixed
1. **Missing annotation_labelmap parameter** - Now included in uploads
2. **COCO format validation** - Added comprehensive validation
3. **SDK version compatibility** - Upgraded to latest version
4. **Alternative upload method** - Added individual image upload with annotations

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added annotation_labelmap Parameter
The main fix is including the `annotation_labelmap` parameter:
```python
annotation_labelmap = {cat['id']: cat['name'] for cat in categories_data}
result = workspace.upload_dataset(
    dataset_path,
    project_id,
    annotation_labelmap=annotation_labelmap  # KEY FIX!
)
```

### 2. Enhanced COCO Validation
- Validates all image files exist
- Checks annotation-image consistency  
- Verifies category ID mapping
- Reports orphaned annotations

### 3. Alternative Upload Method
If bulk upload fails, the app now includes an individual upload method:
- Uses `project.single_upload()` for each image
- Converts COCO to Roboflow annotation format
- Falls back to REST API for annotations

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if annotation_labelmap not supported
- Detailed progress logging
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Usage Instructions

1. **Update your dataset**: Make sure your COCO annotations.json is valid
2. **Use the fixed upload**: The main upload function now includes all fixes
3. **Check Roboflow dashboard**: Verify annotations appear correctly
4. **Try individual upload**: If bulk upload fails, the app will suggest alternatives

## Troubleshooting

### If annotations still don't appear:
1. Check the upload log for validation errors
2. Verify your COCO categories have consistent IDs
3. Ensure image files match the annotations.json entries
4. Try the debug tool: `python debug_roboflow_upload.py`

### SDK Version Issues:
- Run this script to upgrade: `python fix_roboflow_annotations.py`
- Check version with: `python -c "import roboflow; print(roboflow.__version__)"`
- Minimum recommended version: 1.0.0+

## Expected Results
With these fixes, you should see:
- ‚úÖ All images uploaded successfully
- ‚úÖ All annotations preserved and visible in Roboflow
- ‚úÖ Correct category labels and bounding boxes
- ‚úÖ Proper class mapping maintained

The fixes address the core issues that cause annotations to be lost during SDK uploads.
